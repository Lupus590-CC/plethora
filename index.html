			<p>
				Using Plethora, ComputerCraft computers can use almost every tile entity as a peripheral. With
				integration with a wide range of mods, Plethora allows you to interact with the world in new ways.

	<h3>Fancy modules</h3>
	<div class="desc-row">

		<div class="desc-text">
			<p>
				Plethora adds a collection of items, known as modules, which can be used in a Manipulator. Modules
				expose additional functionality to computers.
			</p>
			<p>
				For instance, the block scanner can gather information about nearby blocks, and the introspection module
				allows computers to interface with the player's inventory.

	<h3>Total annihilation</h3>
	<div class="desc-row">
		<img class="desc-image" src="{{ "/images/modules.png" | relative_url }}" />
		<div class="desc-text">
			<p>
				Amongst the other modules included are entity sensor and laser guns. Combine the two and you've got a
				pretty nifty little mob defence system right there.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other items can also be used as modules. Place a clock in a manipulator to find the time of day, use a
				daylight sensor to get the light level and play a happy working song with a noteblock.
			</p>
			<p>
				Of course, all Plethora modules have an in-game use too. I'll leave that up to you to discover though.

				If you've ever wanted to embed a computer in your skull then this is the mod for you! The neural
				interface combines the portability of a pocket computer and the power of modules, allowing you to
				directly interact with the player wearing it.

				Yeah. You can put it on animals too. Combine this with the kinetic augment module and you can control
				the animal however you want. Skeleton army? Check. Remote control creepers? Check. Your enemies will
				tremble before your terrifying programming skills.

				You know, I have one simple request. And that is to have <del>sharks</del> squid with frickin' laser

			<p>
				Yep. I bet you didn't even know you wanted this until you read it.
